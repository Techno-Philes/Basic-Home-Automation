# Home-Automation

How cool is it to make your tasks simple? This is a basic DIY Project that I made using Arduino. 

### Components Required:
1. Arduino Uno
2. 4 - Module Relay (5V)
3. AC Power Source
4. Resistors
5. Bread Board
6. Jumper Wires
7. Blynk App
8. LEDs or Bulbs

We are going to connect our Arduino and relay module using AC Power Source. Then the pins are respectively connected as given in the code. Then we should connect the Blynk app using the **token**. After Finishing that add four buttons and assign **Virtual Pins** to them. 

After finishing these steps, our **Basic Home Automation System** is ready!!
